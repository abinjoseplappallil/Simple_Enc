Simple encryption using VbScript
// Got some problems when encrypting a long message, but works fine with short messages
Key used is 4
It shifts 4 letters right to the original 
ie, A will be considered as D 
B will be considered as E and so on.

The input message is first reversed and corresponding hash messageis created 
hello == olleh
ifoos == soofi
This is how it works
